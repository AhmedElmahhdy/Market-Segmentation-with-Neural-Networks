Capstone: Market Segmentation with Neural Networks

Project Overview:
This project involves segmenting the market using a neural network model. 
It utilizes the Online Retail Dataset to analyze customer spending patterns.

Steps Performed:
1. Dataset Selection and Preparation:
   - Chose the Online Retail Dataset.
   - Cleaned missing values and handled outliers.
   - Created new features like 'TotalPrice'.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Analyzed the distribution of key features like TotalPrice.
   - Generated a correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Extracted temporal features (month, day).
   - Aggregated customer-level data with total spending and activity metrics.

4. Preprocessing for Neural Network:
   - Normalized data using StandardScaler.

5. Neural Network Development:
   - Built a neural network with TensorFlow.
   - Used a 128-64-32 architecture with dropout layers for regularization.

6. Training and Evaluation:
   - Segmented customers into 3 groups using K-means.
   - Trained and evaluated the model with one-hot encoded labels.

7. Insights and Market Segmentation:
   - Segment 0: Low spenders; suggest discounts.
   - Segment 1: Moderate spenders; loyalty programs.
   - Segment 2: High spenders; premium products.

8. Recommendations:
   - Strategies tailored to each segment to boost engagement and revenue.

9. Documentation:
   - All findings saved to 'segmented_customers.csv'.
